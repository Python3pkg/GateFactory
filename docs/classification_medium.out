___ GATEFACTORY MEDIUM CLASSIFICATION (CATDOG) EXAMPLE ___

Load CIFAR-10 dataset
Pick random 200 cat and 200 dog images from the CIFAR-10 data batch to TRAIN the factory
Pick random 100 cat and 100 dog images from the CIFAR-10 test batch to TEST the factory
Create a new GateFactory with input size of 3072 and output size of 1
Factory has been started
